Mince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet)

Add 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar

Soy sauce to taste (About 2 tsp)

Add 2 tablespoon Plum Sake

Boil off alcohol

3 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha

Add 4 tablespoons brown sugar

Red pepper flakes to taste

Minced Ginger to taste



Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it's important to use it. don't use all white sugar, but you can use all brown. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I'd definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavor.



If you want to make this more authentic Szechuan, replace the Sriracha with Chili Bean sauce - commonly called Toban Djan at your local Asian grocery store. Or, even better if you can find it, actual Pixian Broad Bean Paste.
